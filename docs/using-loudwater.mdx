In this guide, we'll go over how to view, query, and update data in your postgres using Loudwater.

## Connecting a database

To connect with a database, select 'select database > new database'.

| Property     | Description                                                      |
| ------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Name         | A friendly name for the database                                 |
| Postgres URL | The fully qualified connection string for your postgres instance |
| Schema       | The database schema to use, default: public                      |

## Tables

Once you've connected a database to your Loudwater, you will see a list of the tables in your database in the lefthand bar.

These tables give you a simple, spreadsheet-like way to interact with your database.

### Filtering

You can build complex filter using the filter box at the top of the table page. These filters will be applied in the SQL query run on your database.

### Sorting

To sort a column in ascending or descending order, right-click on the column or select the carrat dropdown on the column you would like to sort.

This will apply to all the data in that table, not just the rows that have been loaded, so it may take a moment to update.

## Updating values

Just like with a spreadsheet, you can select one of the cells in the table, if you double-click, you will be able to update that value in your database.

Note: Updates will only be applied if the connected database has write permissions, additionally, any other restrictions on the column will be enforced by the database.

## Editing table appearance

You can set a number of fields to make your table visually stand out. Click the 'edit' button on the table page and you can set a color and icon for the table.

You can also set the table name and description by clicking on them on the main table page.

## Querying

In the query section, you can create SQL queries against the database.

Note: 'UPDATE' queries WILL work if you have write permission, so use caution, we will be adding permissions soon so hang tight!
