You can host Loudwater yourself, either locally or on your own cloud, or you can use a hosted version provided by Bruinen.
We'll be launching our hosted version soon, so if you'd like to get on the list, sign up here.

# Setup from scratch

This guide will take you through the steps necessary to get up and running with Loudwater.

### Before you begin

To use Loudwater you need the following installed in your system: [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads) and Docker ([Windows](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/install/windows-install/), [MacOS](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/install/mac-install/), or [Linux](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/install/linux-install/)).

### 1. Get the code

Run the following command in your CLI to clone the Loudwater repository:

```
git clone https://github.com/bruinenxyz/loudwater.git
```

### 2. Copy default env variables

Enter the Loudwater root directory:

```
cd loudwater
```

Run the following commands to copy the default environment variables:

```
cp ./backend/.env.example ./backend/.env
cp ./frontend/.env.example ./frontend/.env
```

### 3. Build & run

There are two ways to "build" your Loudwater deployment. You can either use our pre-built Docker images or build locally on your machine.

**Use pre-built Docker images (recommended)**

Run the following command in the Loudwater root directory to pull the required images from our [Loudwater Docker Hub repository](https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/bruinenco/loudwater/tags) and run your local deployment of Loudwater:

```
docker compose up -d
```

**Build locally (for development)**

Run the following command in the Loudwater root directory to build and run your local deployment of Loudwater:

```
docker compose -f docker-compose.build.yml up --build -d
```

### 4. Start using Loudwater

Once your Docker containers are up and running, visit http://localhost:8000 in your browser to start using Loudwater.
