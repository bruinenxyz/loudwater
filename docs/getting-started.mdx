This guide will take you through the steps necessary to get up and running with Loudwater.

## Before you begin

To use Loudwater you need the following installed in your system: [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads) and Docker ([Windows](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/install/windows-install/), [MacOS](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/install/mac-install/), or [Linux](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/install/linux-install/)).

## 1. Get the code

Run the following command in your CLI to pull the Loudwater code:

```
git clone https://github.com/bruinenxyz/loudwater.git
```

## 2. Copy the default env variables

Run the following commands in the Loudwater root directory to copy the default environment variables:

```
cp ./backend/.env.example ./backend/.env
cp ./frontend/.env.example ./frontend/.env
```

## 3. Configure custom env variables

Update the `backend/.env` file:

- `CREDENTIAL_SECRET`: The secret used to encrypt postgres connection credentials. Replace the default value with your own secret. (Recommended)
- `DATABASE_URL`: The connection URL for the postgres DB used by Loudwater. (Optional)
- `SENTRY_DSN`: A [Sentry](https://sentry.io/welcome/) Data Source Name (DSN). Provide a DSN string if you would like to use Sentry to track the performance of your Loudwater deployment. (Optional)

## 4. Build & run

Run the following command to build the Docker images and run your local deployment of Loudwater:

```
docker compose -f docker-compose.yml up --build -d
```
